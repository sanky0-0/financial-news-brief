<h3 id="macro-policy">Macro policy</h3>
<p>The headlines reflect a broader theme of uncertainty and contention within various economic policies and frameworks, highlighting the challenges faced by governments and businesses in navigating regulatory environments. The emphasis on trade systems, budgetary constraints, and market regulations suggests that without clear and consistent policies, both technological and economic progress may be hindered, potentially leading to market instability and inefficiencies. This underscores the need for cohesive strategies that can foster collaboration and clarity among stakeholders to ensure sustainable growth.</p>

<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>
<p>The energy sector is currently navigating a complex landscape marked by OPEC+'s decision to increase oil production amid fluctuating global demand and geopolitical tensions. While this move aims to stabilize prices, particularly as Brent crude hovers above $65, concerns arise regarding the long-term sustainability of such production levels, especially in regions like Nigeria where industry reforms are seen as regressive. Additionally, the anticipated growth in the LNG filling station market suggests a shift towards alternative energy sources, highlighting the ongoing transition within the energy sector as stakeholders grapple with both immediate production strategies and future sustainability.</p>

Additionally, issues such as Norway's wealth tax debate and trade tensions in the U.S. reveal how domestic policies can influence broader geopolitical dynamics, suggesting that internal challenges may have significant implications for international relations and security.</p>
