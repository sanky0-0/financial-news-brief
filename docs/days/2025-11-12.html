<p>Today’s financial landscape is shaped by rising inflation expectations as October data is anticipated to surpass 2%. In corporate earnings, notable movements include Circle's stock decline despite revenue growth, while Tata Steel reports a significant profit increase driven by robust demand. Meanwhile, the energy sector sees oil prices climbing due to refined product demand, and geopolitical dynamics continue to influence market sentiment, particularly in Taiwan. As central banks maintain interest rates, the interplay between macroeconomic indicators and corporate performance remains critical for investors.</p>
