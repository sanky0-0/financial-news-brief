<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>
<p>The upcoming IPO of Bharat Coking Coal, set to list on January 19, has sparked discussions among investors regarding the potential for profit-taking versus holding onto shares for long-term gains. This reflects a broader trend in the energy sector where investors are weighing immediate returns against the volatility and growth prospects of coal-related investments amid shifting energy policies and market dynamics. The implications suggest that as the energy landscape evolves, investors may need to adopt more strategic approaches to navigate both opportunities and risks in the sector.</p>

<h3 id="geopolitics">Geopolitics</h3>
<p>The headlines reflect a growing trend where economic considerations are increasingly overshadowing traditional diplomatic relations, as seen in the interactions between global leaders like Erdoğan and Trump, and during trade-focused visits such as that of the B.C. Premier to India. This shift suggests that nations may prioritize economic partnerships over resolving geopolitical tensions, potentially leading to a more transactional international landscape. The implications of this trend could result in heightened competition and instability, particularly in regions like Ukraine and Taiwan, where economic interests are deeply intertwined with security concerns.</p>
