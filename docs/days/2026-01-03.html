<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>
<p>The headlines reflect a complex interplay of geopolitical tensions and energy dynamics, particularly focusing on oil imports and exports involving Russia, Venezuela, and the United States. As India increases its imports of Russian oil amid U.S. scrutiny, the ongoing U.S.-Venezuela tensions highlight the strategic importance of oil in international relations, with analysts suggesting that while risks are elevated, the immediate impact on oil supply may be limited. This situation underscores the fragility of global energy markets, influenced by political maneuvers and the shifting alliances among major oil-producing nations.</p>
