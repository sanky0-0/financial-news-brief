<h2 id="today-at-a-glance">Today at a Glance</h2>
<p>Today, market sentiment reflects a mix of cautious optimism and underlying challenges. While duty-free cotton provides temporary relief for textile stocks, uncertainties surrounding US tariffs persist. European shares are anticipated to open lower as investors await Nvidia's earnings, while EPIC Suisse's profit growth reinforces its positive outlook. In the energy sector, rising olive oil prices raise questions about sustainability, and geopolitical tensions continue to affect resource extraction in Ukraine. Amid these dynamics, bond investments are gaining attention as potential rate hikes loom, influencing market strategies.</p>

<h3 id="macro-policy">Macro policy</h3>
<p>The recent duty-free cotton import policy provides a temporary relief for textile stocks, enhancing their profitability amid rising costs. However, the persistent uncertainty surrounding potential US tariffs poses a significant risk, suggesting that while the immediate outlook may seem positive, long-term stability for the sector remains precarious. This duality highlights the need for textile companies to navigate both short-term gains and looming regulatory challenges effectively.</p>

<p>The energy sector is experiencing significant fluctuations, particularly in oil and olive oil prices, which are both trending upward. The rising costs of olive oil, now 128% above average, raise questions about market dynamics and sustainability, while the global crude oil market sees increased prices, prompting countries like India to seek the best deals from various suppliers. These trends suggest a broader concern over energy affordability and supply chain stability, impacting consumers and industries reliant on these essential commodities.</p>
