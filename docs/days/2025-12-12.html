<p>Today, the EU's new tariff on small packages from China reflects ongoing trade tensions, while companies like LDLC show resilience by returning to profitability. In the tech sector, Amazon's significant investment in India highlights a strategic push towards AI and job creation. Meanwhile, energy revenues for Russia are declining, and the U.S. government is contemplating actions regarding captured oil, indicating a complex geopolitical landscape. As financial markets adjust, expectations for a Bank of England rate cut next week could impact both savers and borrowers.</p>

<h3 id="macro-policy">Macro policy</h3>
<p>Recent macroeconomic developments highlight a complex interplay between trade policies, monetary measures, and economic growth concerns. The EU's introduction of a tariff on small packages from China reflects a protective stance amid rising prices, while China's push for growth stimulus underscores its struggle with internal imbalances. Additionally, the Central Bank's interest rate cuts and the postponement of the internal combustion engine ban signal a cautious approach to managing inflation and economic stability, as evidenced by the UK's unexpected GDP decline impacting the pound. Overall, these trends suggest a cautious navigation through global economic challenges, with implications for trade dynamics and consumer behavior.</p>
