Earnings reports indicate steady growth in the furniture sector, and tech giants are exploring subscription models to enhance revenue streams.

<p>The headlines reflect a global focus on labor market dynamics and economic policy adjustments in response to demographic changes and geopolitical tensions. Countries are grappling with the implications of an aging workforce, the rise of gig economies, and the need for inclusive job creation, particularly in emerging markets like India.
