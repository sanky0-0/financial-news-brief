As various regions grapple with rising costs and stagnant wages, there is a call for effective fiscal measures to address these challenges, particularly in Europe and emerging markets like Mexico and Indonesia. The mixed performance of European shares ahead of US inflation data underscores the interconnectedness of global markets and the anticipation of policy responses to mitigate inflationary pressures.</p>

Companies are increasingly investing in AI capabilities, as seen in Microsoft's significant deal for GPU capacity and McKinsey's hiring plans, while startups like Upstage are emerging to contribute to independent AI projects.

<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>
<p>The recent headlines reflect a dual focus in the European energy sector: the push for stricter sanctions against Russian oil entities, as advocated by France and Germany, and the proactive steps taken by companies like Electrica and Romgaz towards enhancing renewable energy capabilities. This juxtaposition highlights the EU's commitment to reducing reliance on Russian energy while simultaneously investing in sustainable alternatives, signaling a strategic shift towards energy independence and environmental responsibility. The implications suggest a potential acceleration in the transition to renewables, alongside ongoing geopolitical tensions influencing energy policies.</p>

<p>The stock market experienced a robust close, driven by gains in the IT, Pharma, and FMCG sectors, as investor sentiment was buoyed by hopes of a potential rate cut in the US.
