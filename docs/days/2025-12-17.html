<p>The earnings outlook across sectors reveals a stark contrast, with the Indian medical devices sector showing promising progress under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, indicating potential growth and investment opportunities by 2026.

This divergence suggests that while some sectors may thrive with supportive policies, others may struggle without adequate intervention.</p>
