<h2 id="today-at-a-glance">Today at a Glance</h2>
<p>Today’s economic landscape reflects a mix of easing inflation in Slovenia and Poland, suggesting potential stabilization in the region. While industrial and service revenues are bolstered by exports, some companies, like Tortilla, face profit warnings despite overall strong performance. In the tech sector, strategic acquisitions signal growth ambitions, particularly in AI and event technology. Meanwhile, oil prices are under pressure, contrasting with BP's significant investment aimed at future growth. Amidst these developments, concerns over treasury yields and geopolitical tensions continue to influence market sentiment.</p>

<h3 id="macro-policy">Macro policy</h3>
<p>Recent headlines indicate a mixed landscape for inflation across Europe, with Slovenia experiencing a notable decrease to 2.6% and Poland showing signs of stabilization, suggesting a potential easing of inflationary pressures in the region. However, concerns remain as evidenced by the CAC 40's decline, influenced by tariff issues and inflation data, highlighting the ongoing challenges that macroeconomic policies face. The approval of a significant supplementary budget in Nigeria further underscores the global trend of governments adjusting fiscal strategies to navigate economic uncertainties.</p>
