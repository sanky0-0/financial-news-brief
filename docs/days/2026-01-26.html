<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>
<p>The common thread among these headlines is the significant geopolitical shifts impacting energy markets, particularly in Europe, as the EU moves to eliminate reliance on Russian gas by 2027 amidst ongoing conflicts. This transition is likely to drive changes in energy sourcing and pricing, as evidenced by Lidl's price reductions on essential goods, which may reflect broader economic adjustments in response to energy costs. Additionally, public support for nuclear energy in Poland indicates a potential pivot towards alternative energy sources as countries navigate the complexities of energy security and market stability in a turbulent geopolitical landscape.</p>
