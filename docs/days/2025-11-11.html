<h2 id="today-at-a-glance">Today at a Glance</h2>
<p>Today, global markets are navigating a complex landscape shaped by geopolitical tensions and evolving macro policies. China's new regulations on rare earth exports highlight ongoing trade frictions with the U.S., while domestic economic discussions in the U.S. reveal contentious views on tariffs. In the corporate sector, promising earnings forecasts from companies like Jazz Pharmaceuticals contrast with broader economic uncertainties. Meanwhile, advancements in AI technology and renewable energy initiatives signal a shift towards innovation and sustainability, even as housing policies face scrutiny amid calls for eviction moratoriums.</p>

<h3 id="macro-policy">Macro policy</h3>
<p>The headlines reflect a growing concern over trade policies and their potential economic repercussions, particularly in the context of rising tariffs and regulatory measures. As countries like China implement stricter export controls and the U.S. considers tariffs, there are fears of inflation and artificial scarcity in essential goods. Additionally, the implications of these policies extend to broader economic stability, with discussions around subsidies and digital currencies highlighting the complexities of maintaining fiscal health while navigating geopolitical tensions.</p>
