<h3 id="energy">Energy</h3>
<p>Recent headlines indicate a rising concern over oversupply in the oil market, leading to a modest increase in oil prices by 1%. This suggests that while demand may be stable, the potential for excess supply could create volatility in pricing, impacting both producers and consumers. The implications of this trend could affect investment strategies and energy policy decisions moving forward.</p>

<h3 id="rates">Rates</h3>
<p>Recent trends indicate a decline in long-term government bond yields, reflecting growing market expectations for potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
