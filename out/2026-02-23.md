### Macro policy

The recent headlines reflect a turbulent macroeconomic environment influenced by U.S. trade policies, particularly the imposition of a 15% global tariff by the Trump administration. This move has sparked a mixed response in financial markets, with investors seeking safe havens like gold amid uncertainty, while also highlighting the broader implications for international trade relations and human rights considerations.
