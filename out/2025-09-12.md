## Why this matters
### Why this matters

- Rising retail inflation at 2.07% could lead to increased food prices, impacting consumer spending and potentially affecting earnings for companies in the food sector, such as Coffee Holding Company [navbharattimes; manilatimes].

- The EU's ban on combustion engines by 2035 may accelerate investments in electric vehicle technology, benefiting companies like Shell as they pivot towards renewable energy sources [sn-online; boerse-express].

- The central bank's uncertain stance in the USA could influence interest rates, affecting the performance of long-term bonds like the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF ($TLT) and subsequently impacting sectors reliant on financing [kauppalehti; dailypolitical].

- The resurgence of SAPO amidst market volatility, including Apple's recent struggles, highlights the tech sector's sensitivity to macroeconomic shifts, which could affect investor sentiment across tech stocks [sapo; monitoruldegalati].

- The shrinking oil and gas workforce may signal a transition towards renewable energy jobs, aligning with policies aimed at reducing coal dependency, which could impact traditional energy companies and their stock performance [rigzone; finanza].
