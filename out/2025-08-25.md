### Rates

Recent headlines indicate a growing optimism in Asian markets, driven by expectations of potential interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve. This sentiment is juxtaposed with concerns about the Fed's hawkish stance, particularly highlighted during events like Jackson Hole.

Additionally, the rise of the Middle East in global markets, alongside domestic political shifts in Japan, suggests that nations are navigating both internal challenges and external pressures while seeking growth opportunities in a volatile global landscape.
