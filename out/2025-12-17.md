## Daily Brief

Central banks and governments are grappling with inflationary pressures and budgetary constraints, as seen in the EU and Turkey, while also navigating political dynamics that influence fiscal strategies. The implications suggest a cautious approach to monetary policy, with an emphasis on maintaining stability amid rising costs and shifting regulatory landscapes, particularly in sectors like automotive manufacturing.

### Earnings

The earnings outlook across sectors reveals a stark contrast, with the Indian medical devices sector showing promising progress under the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, indicating potential growth and investment opportunities by 2026. In contrast, the agricultural sector in Malaga faces significant challenges, highlighted by a substantial revenue decline of 39 million in 2025, underscoring vulnerabilities in the industry that could affect local economies and employment. This divergence suggests that while some sectors may thrive with supportive policies, others may struggle without adequate intervention.
