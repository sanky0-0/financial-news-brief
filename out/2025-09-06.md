## Why this matters
### Why this matters

- The planned budget for 2026-2028, which may threaten judicial independence, could lead to increased political instability, impacting investor confidence in sectors reliant on stable governance, such as energy and tech [m.kauno.diena.lt; globovision.com].

- A 24.2% increase in state budget revenues alongside a 23.7% rise in expenditures suggests a tightening fiscal environment, which could affect funding for renewable energy projects and tech initiatives, particularly in states fast-tracking permits [ua.interfax.com.ua; grist.org].

- OPEC+'s upcoming decision on oil supply could influence inflation rates, which are being actively repressed; this may affect sectors like healthcare, where hospitals are already facing financial pressures due to rising operational costs [globovision.com; eptrail.com].

- The development of AI models in Chongqing and discussions by AMD on advanced technologies highlight the growing intersection of tech and energy sectors, particularly as green jobs are promoted by companies like Pertamina [finance.sina.com.cn; liputan6.com].

- Geopolitical tensions, such as Hungary's opposition to Ukraine's EU membership, could disrupt cross-border e-commerce initiatives in Vietnam, potentially impacting tech firms looking to expand in the region [timpul.md;
