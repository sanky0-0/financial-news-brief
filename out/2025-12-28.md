## Daily Brief

### Macro policy

This transparency aims to bolster market confidence and guide economic expectations, especially as countries like Vietnam anticipate significant GDP milestones. The implications suggest a broader trend of central banks focusing on clear communication and strategic planning to navigate economic uncertainties and foster growth.

### Earnings

The recent earnings reports highlight a mixed landscape for various sectors, with some companies facing significant challenges while others maintain a positive outlook. Notably, the entry of social security funds into leading satellite navigation firms suggests a strategic investment despite recent price declines, indicating potential long-term value. Conversely, companies like JIK are struggling with losses, reflecting the volatility in the market, while sectors like food delivery are poised for growth, driven by evolving consumer expectations. Overall, the implications point to a cautious yet opportunistic investment environment, where sectors adapting to technological changes and consumer demands may thrive amidst broader economic uncertainties.

### Energy

Vontobel Holding Ltd.'s decision to reduce its holdings in the Global X Uranium ETF suggests a cautious approach towards the uranium sector, possibly reflecting concerns about market volatility or shifting investment strategies. This move may indicate broader trends in energy investment, where firms are reassessing their exposure to specific commodities amid changing regulatory and environmental landscapes. As investors navigate these dynamics, the implications could lead to increased volatility in uranium-related assets and a reevaluation of energy portfolios.

### Rates

The headlines indicate a trend of declining interest rates leading into 2025, with significant cuts in mortgage rates and a notable decrease in gross Treasury yields. This environment of lower borrowing costs could stimulate economic activity by making loans more affordable for consumers and businesses, potentially boosting the housing market and overall investment. However, it may also raise concerns about inflation and the long-term sustainability of such monetary policies.

### Geopolitics

The headlines reflect a complex interplay of geopolitical tensions, particularly focusing on the shifting power dynamics in Asia and Eastern Europe. With forecasts suggesting potential changes in U.S. foreign policy under a possible Trump presidency, there is a notable pivot in investment strategies from China and Indonesia towards India and Taiwan, indicating a realignment of economic interests in response to regional conflicts. The ongoing war in Ukraine and the looming threat of China's actions towards Taiwan further complicate the landscape, suggesting that these geopolitical developments could significantly influence global stability and economic strategies in the coming years.

## Why this matters
### Why this matters

- The TCMB's 2026 Monetary Policy statement indicates a potential shift in interest rates, which could impact sectors reliant on borrowing, such as infrastructure, where HHV is projecting positive profit growth for 2025. [haberler.com; baodautu.vn]

- Vietnam's GDP nearing $1 trillion may attract foreign investment, particularly in technology sectors, as evidenced by the interest in edge AI opportunities highlighted by MINIMAX's prospectus. [baodautu.vn; stock.finance.sina.com.cn]

- The recent cloud outage affecting SAP stock could signal vulnerabilities in tech infrastructure, potentially impacting investor sentiment in AI-related companies like NVIDIA, which is aggressively expanding its GPU capabilities. [stock-world.de; finance.sina.com.cn]

- The reduction in gross Treasury raises by the end of November 2025 may lead to lower mortgage interest rates starting January 1, which could stimulate the housing market and indirectly benefit infrastructure investments like those from HHV. [libe.ma; finance.gxnews.com.cn]

- The decline in the price-to-earnings ratio for leading satellite navigation companies, despite new investments from social security funds, suggests a cautious outlook in the tech sector, which could be influenced by broader economic policies from the TCMB. [ca
