## Daily Brief

### Macro policy

The headlines reflect a global landscape marked by shifting economic policies and rising tensions over trade, particularly in response to tariff threats from the U.S. Japan's bond yields are influenced by domestic political changes and expectations of fiscal stimulus, while European leaders are urged to adopt aggressive trade measures to counteract U.S. policies. Concurrently, concerns about weak growth and the impact of tariffs are causing market volatility, highlighting the interconnectedness of global economic strategies and the potential for significant implications on growth and investment across regions.

### Earnings

The earnings reports indicate a trend of declining profitability despite modest revenue growth, as seen with Halliburton's lower profits alongside a slight revenue increase. This suggests that companies may be facing rising costs or operational challenges that are eroding margins, which could signal broader economic pressures affecting industry performance, as highlighted by the decrease in PMI reported by Unioncamere E-R. Overall, these developments may point to a cautious outlook for future earnings across sectors.

Companies are aggressively pursuing AI innovations, as seen in the release of humanoid robots and the expansion of AI research operations, while also addressing the challenges posed by economic disparities and market confidence.
