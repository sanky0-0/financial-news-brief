### Tech/AI

The headlines reflect a growing recognition of both the potential and limitations of artificial intelligence across various sectors, highlighting the need for a balanced approach to its integration.

This duality suggests that as industries increasingly rely on AI, they must also navigate the complexities of digital sovereignty and the inherent contradictions within AI development, ensuring that innovation does not come at the cost of accountability and security.
