## Today at a Glance
Today’s economic landscape reflects a mix of easing inflation in Slovenia and Poland, suggesting potential stabilization in the region. While industrial and service revenues are bolstered by exports, some companies, like Tortilla, face profit warnings despite overall strong performance. In the tech sector, strategic acquisitions signal growth ambitions, particularly in AI and event technology. Meanwhile, oil prices are under pressure, contrasting with BP's significant investment aimed at future growth. Amidst these developments, concerns over treasury yields and geopolitical tensions continue to influence market sentiment.

## Daily Brief

### Macro policy

Recent headlines indicate a mixed landscape for inflation across Europe, with Slovenia experiencing a notable decrease to 2.6% and Poland showing signs of stabilization, suggesting a potential easing of inflationary pressures in the region. However, concerns remain as evidenced by the CAC 40's decline, influenced by tariff issues and inflation data, highlighting the ongoing challenges that macroeconomic policies face. The approval of a significant supplementary budget in Nigeria further underscores the global trend of governments adjusting fiscal strategies to navigate economic uncertainties.

### Earnings

The earnings landscape reveals a mixed performance across various sectors, with some companies experiencing growth driven by external factors like exports, while others face challenges despite previous successes. For instance, while Lamb Weston saw a surprising surge in Q3 sales, it also reported a decline in Q1 profit, indicating volatility in the food sector. This divergence suggests that while certain industries may benefit from favorable market conditions, others are grappling with internal issues that could impact future profitability.
