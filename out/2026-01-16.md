Recent headlines indicate a significant surge in gas prices across Europe, driven by a combination of extreme cold weather and heightened consumption levels, which have reached their highest in two years. The rapid increase in prices, with a notable 12% rise in just one day, reflects the urgent demand for heating amidst freezing conditions, suggesting potential challenges for consumers and businesses alike. This volatility in the energy market could lead to broader economic implications, including inflationary pressures and increased costs for industries reliant on gas.

### Rates

Bond yields are expected to surpass 4.2%, influenced by the trajectory of the US economy and the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions. This trend suggests that investors are anticipating tighter monetary policy, which could impact borrowing costs and overall economic growth. As yields rise, market participants will closely monitor economic indicators and Fed signals to gauge the sustainability of this upward movement in rates.
