## Daily Brief

### Macro policy

The recent macroeconomic developments highlight a trend of shifting monetary policies and international trade dynamics that could influence currency valuations. With expectations of lower interest rates in the U.S. and a potential depreciation of the Indian rupee, global currencies are under pressure, particularly the dollar. Additionally, geopolitical maneuvers, such as the strengthening of trade ties between Russia and India, suggest that countries are adapting their economic strategies in response to external pressures, which may further impact global economic stability and currency markets.

Meanwhile, SAIC's substantial revenue in FY26 underscores strong performance in the government contracting sector, contrasting with the ongoing scrutiny faced by other industries, as seen in the investigation related to the Sabarimala gold loss.
