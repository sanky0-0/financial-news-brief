As investors adjust their portfolios—evidenced by the sale of high-yield municipal ETFs and reductions in stock holdings—there is a growing sentiment that political tensions may further complicate economic stability. This environment suggests a cautious approach among wealth managers and investors as they navigate the uncertainties leading up to the Fed's decisions.
