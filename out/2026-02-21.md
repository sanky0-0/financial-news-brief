## Daily Brief

### Macro policy

Recent developments surrounding U.S. tariffs, particularly the Supreme Court's decision to cancel Trump's tariffs, signal a significant shift in trade policy that could reshape international relations and economic strategies. The ruling has not only frustrated former President Trump but also raised concerns among global partners, prompting calls for renegotiation of trade agreements, particularly from the EU. As countries brace for potential new tariff changes, the implications for long-term investments and market stability are becoming increasingly pronounced, with U.S. bond markets reacting to the uncertainty surrounding these trade dynamics.
