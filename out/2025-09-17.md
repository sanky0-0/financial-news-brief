## Why this matters
### Why this matters

- A projected dip in India’s bond yields due to easing inflation could enhance investment attractiveness in the Indian market, particularly for sectors reliant on lower borrowing costs, such as real estate and infrastructure [newkerala.com; surreycomet.co.uk].

- Stable inflation rates in the eurozone may influence the European Central Bank's monetary policy, potentially impacting sectors like consumer goods and financial services, which are sensitive to interest rate changes [danas.rs; finance.yahoo.com].

- Nvidia's data center revenue miss highlights potential vulnerabilities in the tech sector, particularly as companies like Google invest heavily in AI infrastructure, suggesting a shift in competitive dynamics within the tech landscape [finance.yahoo.com; phoenixherald.com].

- The EU's strategic oil plans to counter Russia's economy may lead to increased investments in renewable energy sectors, as companies like Acciona Energía divest from traditional energy assets, reflecting a broader transition towards sustainability [soester-anzeiger.de; elconfidencial.com].

- The Federal Reserve's deliberations on interest rate cuts could significantly affect market sentiment, particularly for tech stocks and ETFs like iShares Core Total USD Bond Market ETF, which are sensitive to rate fluctuations [udn.com; dailypolitical.com].
