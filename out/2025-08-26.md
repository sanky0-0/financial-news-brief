## Daily Brief

### Macro policy

The headlines reflect a growing tension between government fiscal policies and external economic pressures, highlighting the challenges faced by leaders in managing budgets and maintaining economic stability. The potential erosion of central bank independence, coupled with rising social budget costs and the impact of tariffs, suggests that policymakers are grappling with balancing immediate financial demands against long-term economic health. This environment may lead to increased scrutiny of government actions and a call for more transparent fiscal strategies to mitigate risks associated with external shocks and internal budgetary constraints.
