## Daily Brief

### Macro policy

The recent headlines reflect a complex interplay of inflationary pressures and macroeconomic policy adjustments across various regions. While some countries, like Croatia, are finalizing budgets amidst these pressures, others, such as the ECB, are maintaining flexible monetary policies to address ongoing inflation risks. Additionally, easing foodservice price inflation and international trade agreements, like those between India and Russia, suggest a potential stabilization in certain sectors, yet the overarching need for competitiveness in industries like renewables highlights the challenges that remain in sustaining economic growth.
