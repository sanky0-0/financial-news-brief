### Earnings

Recent earnings reports have shown a mixed landscape for corporations, with some sectors experiencing significant growth while others face challenges. Notably, Wall Street and the CAC 40 are buoyed by strong corporate earnings, indicating investor optimism, yet concerns arise from the Big 4 banks potentially reaching their credit limits and companies like HelloFresh struggling with declining revenues. This divergence highlights the need for investors to remain cautious, as strong performance in some areas may not be indicative of broader economic health.

### Energy

The energy sector is witnessing a significant surge in demand for gas, with projections indicating a market valuation of USD 4,500 million by 2035, alongside reports of a six-fold increase in cooking gas demand in Nepal. This growing trend underscores the increasing reliance on gas as a primary energy source, highlighting potential challenges in supply chain management and the need for infrastructure improvements to meet rising consumer needs. As demand escalates, stakeholders must navigate the implications for pricing, availability, and sustainability in the energy market.

### Rates

The anticipated rise in long-term U.S. Treasury yields, driven by an oversupply in the market, suggests that the Federal Reserve may face challenges in effectively managing its balance sheet reduction. This scenario could lead to increased borrowing costs and impact investor sentiment, as higher yields typically signal tighter monetary conditions. Overall, the interplay between supply dynamics and Fed policy will be crucial in shaping the economic landscape in the coming months.
