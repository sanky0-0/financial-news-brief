## Daily Brief

### Macro policy

The headlines reflect a global concern over inflation and its impact on economic policies and household budgets. As various regions grapple with rising costs and stagnant wages, there is a call for effective fiscal measures to address these challenges, particularly in Europe and emerging markets like Mexico and Indonesia. The mixed performance of European shares ahead of US inflation data underscores the interconnectedness of global markets and the anticipation of policy responses to mitigate inflationary pressures.

Companies are increasingly investing in AI capabilities, as seen in Microsoft's significant deal for GPU capacity and McKinsey's hiring plans, while startups like Upstage are emerging to contribute to independent AI projects.

This juxtaposition highlights the EU's commitment to reducing reliance on Russian energy while simultaneously investing in sustainable alternatives, signaling a strategic shift towards energy independence and environmental responsibility. The implications suggest a potential acceleration in the transition to renewables, alongside ongoing geopolitical tensions influencing energy policies.
