Notably, while unemployment has decreased, the rising inactivity rate suggests that many individuals are still disengaged from the labor market, which could hinder consumer spending. Additionally, despite wage increases, European consumers remain hesitant to spend, reflecting broader concerns about economic stability and confidence. This combination of factors may impact future earnings and growth prospects across industries.
