## Daily Brief

### Macro policy

The headlines reflect a growing tension in global trade dynamics, with various nations grappling with the implications of tariffs and trade agreements. Protests against trade agreements in Mercosur and accelerated tariff negotiations between Indonesia and the US highlight the complexities of international commerce, while the potential for significant US tariffs on Russian oil indicates a shift towards more aggressive trade policies. These developments suggest that countries are increasingly prioritizing national interests and economic sovereignty, which could lead to heightened volatility in global markets and impact inflation trends.
