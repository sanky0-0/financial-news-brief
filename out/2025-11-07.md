### Tech/AI

The headlines reflect a growing emphasis on artificial intelligence (AI) across various sectors, highlighting its potential to drive innovation, enhance productivity, and create new economic opportunities. Initiatives such as training programs for AI professionals and the integration of AI in industries like law and finance suggest a strategic pivot towards leveraging technology for competitive advantage. However, the mixed reactions to AI investments, as seen with Rightmove's share decline, indicate that while AI presents significant growth prospects, it also carries risks that stakeholders must navigate carefully.

### Energy

Recent headlines indicate a rising concern over oversupply in the oil market, leading to a modest increase in oil prices by 1%. This suggests that while demand may be stable, the potential for excess supply could create volatility in pricing, impacting both producers and consumers. The implications of this trend could affect investment strategies and energy policy decisions moving forward.

### Rates

Recent trends indicate a decline in long-term government bond yields, reflecting growing market expectations for potential rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This shift suggests a more accommodative monetary policy environment, which could stimulate economic activity but also raises concerns about inflationary pressures if growth accelerates. Overall, the interplay between interest rates and currency valuations may lead to increased volatility in financial markets as investors adjust their strategies in response to these developments.

The marine waste management workshop in Bangkok highlights a collaborative effort among Indo-Pacific nations to address environmental issues while strengthening partnerships, particularly in the face of rising geopolitical challenges. Concurrently, military developments, such as Saab's expansion in Canada and the potential for U.S. military action in Venezuela, underscore the urgency for nations to bolster their defense capabilities amidst ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and tensions surrounding Taiwan. This convergence of environmental cooperation and military preparedness suggests a complex landscape where nations are navigating both ecological and security concerns.
