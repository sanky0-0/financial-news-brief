The European Central Bank's introduction of the digital euro aims to enhance payment efficiency, while mixed responses to budget proposals and business sentiment indicate underlying uncertainties in fiscal support and economic stability. Additionally, the stagnation in China's passenger car market following the withdrawal of subsidies highlights the broader implications of policy changes on consumer behavior and economic growth.

### Earnings

The recent earnings reports from various companies highlight a mixed landscape in financial performance for the third quarter of 2025. While several firms, such as K92 Mining and EVgo, exceeded expectations and reported strong financial results, others like monday.com faced significant stock declines despite beating earnings forecasts. This divergence suggests that market reactions to earnings can be influenced by broader investor sentiment and expectations, indicating that strong financial performance does not always guarantee positive stock performance.
