### Macro policy

Recent macroeconomic developments indicate a nuanced landscape for inflation, with the U.S. reporting a smaller-than-anticipated rise in September, which has positively influenced market sentiment. However, the complexities of inflation trends are underscored by varying reports from other nations, such as Russia's response to sanctions through interest rate adjustments. These dynamics suggest that while some economies may experience easing inflation pressures, others face challenges that could impact global economic stability and policy responses moving forward.
