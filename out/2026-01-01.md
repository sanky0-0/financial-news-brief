## Daily Brief

### Macro policy

The recent headlines reflect a complex interplay of macroeconomic policies and their implications for inflation and trade. While the delay in tariff hikes by Trump suggests a strategic move to mitigate immediate economic pressures, Iran's ongoing protests highlight the social unrest stemming from soaring inflation, exacerbated by external trade policies. Meanwhile, China's imposition of steep tariffs on imported beef and the planned VAT increase signal a tightening of fiscal measures that could further strain consumer prices and economic stability in the region.

### Earnings

The recent headlines reflect a mixed economic landscape, with rising GST collections indicating a modest growth in domestic revenue, while housing prices and luxury land turnover show significant increases, suggesting a robust real estate market. However, the focus on earnings guidance and investment strategies for 2026 highlights the uncertainty and volatility investors may face in various sectors. Overall, these trends suggest a cautious optimism in certain markets, tempered by the need for strategic planning in the face of potential economic fluctuations.

### Tech/AI

The recent headlines highlight a significant intersection of technology, regulation, and economic trends, particularly in California and the broader market. As new laws come into effect in California, they may reshape local industries, including tech and healthcare, while the anticipated economic landscape for 2026 suggests a growing emphasis on affordability and artificial intelligence. Additionally, investment activities, such as Ninety One's acquisition of shares in Take-Two Interactive, indicate a bullish sentiment towards tech companies, reflecting confidence in their future growth amidst these evolving dynamics.

### Energy

The recent developments in the energy sector highlight a complex interplay of geopolitical dynamics and market adjustments. The U.S. granting a special license for a refinery restart and crude oil imports indicates a strategic maneuver to stabilize domestic supply amidst international tensions, particularly as oil tankers seek refuge under Russian flags to evade EU sanctions. Meanwhile, the reduction of holdings in Cheniere Energy by Ninety One suggests a cautious approach by investors in response to these shifting market conditions, reflecting broader uncertainties in energy investment strategies.

### Geopolitics

The common thread among the headlines revolves around the shifting dynamics of international relations, particularly in the context of U.S. foreign policy and its implications for global conflicts. The suggestion that Trump could alter the course of the Ukraine conflict by distancing from Zelensky and the EU indicates a potential pivot in U.S. strategy that could affect alliances and support structures in Eastern Europe. Similarly, the mention of Taiwan highlights the broader geopolitical tensions in the Asia-Pacific region, suggesting that the U.S. may need to reassess its commitments and strategies in multiple theaters simultaneously, which could lead to significant shifts in global power balances.

### Other

The headlines reflect a mix of celebratory events, economic shifts, and community concerns, highlighting the intersection of local culture and broader financial trends. As cities prepare for significant celebrations and individuals engage in unique activities, there are also pressing issues such as rising electricity prices and potential increases in consumer costs due to changes in CO2 pricing. This suggests a landscape where local festivities coexist with economic pressures, indicating that while communities seek joy and connection, they must also navigate the implications of rising costs and market fluctuations.
