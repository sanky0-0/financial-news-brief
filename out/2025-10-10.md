### Macro policy

The headlines reflect a broader theme of economic challenges and employment dynamics across various regions. Tunisia's currency exchange reform and the warning signs from OJK regarding fiscal issues highlight the struggles of financial stability, while JD.com's commitment to employee development contrasts with the concerning employment levels reported in the 2022 census. Additionally, the implications of trade tensions, as seen in China's retaliatory measures against the US, further complicate the global economic landscape, affecting employment and growth prospects in multiple sectors.
